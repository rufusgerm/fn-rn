That the baby the fetus came out, and it was alive and he had thought he had actually killed it already and the  fetus  opened up his eyes and grabbed his hand, his finger? A lot of times he would bring the big fetus that were over-age in a bag and we would say  Oh my g*d, that s a big baby! It would take us over an hour to do an abortion that big. The women that go there [abortion clinic] have no idea what they re getting themselves into. And a lot of questions would want be,  Does the baby feel?

" The Daily Show Slams Trump And Cruz In Hilarious Double Take-Down (VIDEO)Trevor Noah and The Daily Show had a field day with the feud between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in one of the funniest segments of 2016 thus far.Birtherism has come back to haunt the Tea Party in a big way as their favored candidate is now dealing with the fact that unlike President Obama, he really wasn t born in the United States. Donald Trump has been happy to point that out as Ted Cruz begins to gain in the polls. And this is comedy gold as far as Noah is concerned. The son of an American mother and a foreign father who graduated from Harvard Law School and dreamed of being president, even though   let s face it, people   he wasn t born in America. That s right, we re talking about Ted Cruz   the Canadian-born Texas senator. This even took Noah by surprise because he  didn t know that this shit could happen to Republicans, as well. Like I thought Republicans were the ones who do this, not the ones who get it done to them. This for me is like hearing that someone roofied Bill Cosby. Noah pointed out the way Trump worked the scandal into conversations and how he is particularly fond of using Twitter to launch attacks. But Noah did not let this be a one-sided scandal. In what could be fodder for Ted Cruz to use in a counterattack, Noah reminded the audience that Donald Trump wants to bang his daughter, which is true because he said he saw it on TV.Indeed, Noah did a segment last year chronicling all of the instances in which Trump has creepily talked about his daughter over the years. You can read all about it here.To conclude, Noah urged everyone to start using the hashtag #DonaldTrumpWantsToBangHisDaughter.Here s the video via Comedy Central.And the 2016 race just keeps getting more entertaining.Featured Image via Screenshot",Fake

"World Bank approves $400 million to rebuild liberated Iraqi areasWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The World Bank on Tuesday approved $400 million in additional funding to help rebuild services to Iraqi areas recaptured from Islamic State militants after a three-year military campaign, the global development bank said. The World Bank also said it would fund studies on how to involve the private sector in the reconstruction of Mosul s airport and restoring public transport terminals as well as parts of the railway network.  The package represents an additional financing to the Iraq Emergency Operation for Development Project ($350 million) approved back in July 2015 and already underway in seven cities in Diyala and Salah Ad-Din governorates,  the World Bank said in a statement. It said the new funding would focus on rebuilding in five sectors - water and sanitation, electricity, health, transport and municipal services. The funds will also help with the restoration and preservation of cultural heritage sites in Mosul s Old City, which was heavily damaged by fighting.  Iraqi government forces, backed by a U.S.-led coalition, retook Mosul in May - by far the largest city to fall under militants  control - after nearly nine months of urban warfare. Iraqi government officials have estimated it will take at least five years and billions of dollars to rebuild Mosul. ",Real
" SICK: Trump Told 14-Year-Old Girls He Would Be Dating Them In A Couple YearsAnother bit of news from the past has come back to haunt Donald Trump s already imploding campaign.Only days after an Entertainment Tonight clip went viral showing Donald Trump talking about how he will be dating the 10-year-old girl he just met in ten years, the Chicago Tribune dug into their own archives to find another disturbing news blurb quoting Trump speaking to a pair of 14-year-old girls in 1992. In a December 1992 wire brief in the Chicago Tribune, Trump is described as having spotted a youth choir singing Christmas carols at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan,  the Tribune reported.  He asked two girls how old they were. When they said they were 14, Trump, then 46, replied,  Wow! Just think   in a couple of years, I ll be dating you. Here s the news clipping via the Chicago Tribune. The bit about Trump is at the lower right hand corner under the yellow highlight.There you have it. Donald Trump jumped from disgustingly talking about him dating a 10-year-old girl in ten years to directly telling two 14-year-old girls that he will be dating them in two years. For the record, both girls would still be considered minors under the law. Furthermore, Trump s own daughter Ivanka was 11-years-old at the time, which makes these revelations even creepier.Trump has been under fire for over a week now since his remarks about groping women came to light. Accusations of sexual assault from multiple women, including Miss Teen USA contestants who have revealed that Trump walked in on them in their dressing room to see them naked, have flooded the media ever since and the Republican nominee is struggling to explain himself and his predatory behavior.These revelations also give more credibility to a child rape case that Trump is currently embroiled in, which goes to a status conference in December that Trump must attend. The lawsuit was filed by a woman only known as Jane Doe, who says Trump raped her in 1994 when she was 13 years old.And given the fact that Trump apparently likes openly hitting on underage girls, it sounds like Jane Doe has a case.Donald Trump is a sick man and a pervert who should not be anywhere close to being President of the United States. But Republicans chose him to be their leader and now America is living a nightmare that can only end if Trump and the GOP loses by a total landslide on November 8th.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",Fake
